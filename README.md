## What is it?

ReviewChain is a decentralized peer review system built on top of blockchain technologies. Traditional journals are known for opaque reviewing processes, often resulting in rejections without a clear reason why. ReviewChain aims to democratize science, by first starting with the peer review process.

### Reputation System

On ReviewChain, any user can submit papers and give reviews. To ensure high-quality content, we have implemented a incentive mechanism based on a reputation score, giving users a way to gauge the trustworthiness of a researcher as perceived by the rest of the network.

Researchers can give each other "kudos" on papers, thus increasing the author's reputation score. Researchers can also post comments/reviews which in turn can also receive kudos, thus encouraging high-quality reviews.

### AI Screening

We have also implemented AI screening technologies to ensure that hateful content does not appear on the platform. This helps keep the environment safe and productive for scientists.
